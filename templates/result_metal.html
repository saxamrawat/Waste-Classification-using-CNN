                    <h2>Facts About Metal Waste</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Statistics on Metal Consumption and Waste Generation</h3>
                            <p>The amount of metal consumed worldwide has been rising over time; 1.6 billion metric tons
                                are thought to be consumed each year. This demand is mostly driven by the industrial,
                                construction, automotive, and electronics sectors. But increased consumption is also
                                accompanied by a sizable amount of metal trash production. Globally, 500 million metric
                                tons of metal garbage are produced annually, which includes both industrial and
                                post-consumer waste. A significant amount of this metal trash still ends up in
                                landfills, leading to resource depletion and environmental damage even with attempts to
                                enhance recycling rates.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The key points discussed emphasize the importance of responsible metal waste management for
                        environmental sustainability:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Environmental Impact: Improper disposal of metal waste can cause environmental pollution,
                            soil and water contamination, and risk to ecosystems and human health. Metal waste in
                            landfills contributes to greenhouse gas emissions through anaerobic decomposition.</li>
                        <li>Resource Depletion: Recycling metal waste conserves natural resources, reduces the need for
                            new mining, and mitigates environmental degradation associated with resource extraction.
                        </li>
                        <li>Energy Savings: Recycling metal waste uses much less energy than producing new metals from
                            raw materials. For example, recycling aluminium needs just 5% of the energy required to make
                            it from bauxite ore. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions and helps fight climate change.
                        </li>
                        <li>Economic Value: Metal waste can be recycled and reused, which generates economic
                            opportunities through job creation, revenue generation, and cost savings for businesses.
                        </li>
                        <li>Circular Economy: Metal recycling is important for a circular economy, where materials are
                            reused and recycled to minimize waste and maximize resource efficiency. This creates a
