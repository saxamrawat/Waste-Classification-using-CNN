                    <h2>Facts About Cardboard Waste</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Statistics on Cardboard Consumption and Waste Generation</h3>
                            <p>Cardboard, a prevalent form of paper packaging, contributes significantly to global paper
                                consumption and waste generation. On average, an individual utilizes around 40 kilograms
                                of cardboard annually. In the United States alone, where cardboard usage is prolific in
                                packaging and shipping industries, each person generates approximately 100 pounds of
                                cardboard waste per year. These figures highlight the substantial role of cardboard in
                                the broader issue of paper waste, emphasizing the urgency to address its consumption and
