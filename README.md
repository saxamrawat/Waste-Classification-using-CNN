# Waste Classification Web Application

This repository contains the source code for a waste classification web application built using Flask and Keras. The application allows users to upload images of waste items, which are then classified into distinct categories such as cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash.

## Features
- Upload images for waste classification.
- Real-time classification using a pre-trained DenseNet model.
- Display of predicted waste category based on uploaded images.
- User-friendly interface with intuitive navigation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies
4. Run the application
5. Open a web browser and visit http://localhost:5000 to access the application.

## Usage
1. Upload an image of a waste item.
2. Click on the "Classify" button to initiate the classification process.
3. View the predicted waste category displayed on the result page.
